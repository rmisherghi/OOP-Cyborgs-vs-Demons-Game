The structure of my code for this project I worked on had lots of header and cpp files.
There is a header file for Creature, Demon, Cyberdemon, Elf, Human, and Balrog.
In these header files, I just initialized the constructors and the member functions.
I then wrote definitions for these constructors and defintions for the function in the 
cpp files. In the main function, I created an Elf, Human, Cyberdemon, and Balrog object 
and created a for-loop to give out 5 different results of getDamage function.
